## Introduction/About Me

Hi, I'm Bernardo Sequeira, a sophomore studying Computer Science at ISCTE-IUL, in Portugal. In the past years I've taken a liking for CyberSecurity and would like to pursue a career on it after finishing college.

In this page I'll be posting my write-ups of the Ctfs/Wargames/Whatever I play and complete(or not, i'm a real noob).
