Hmm what's this, some php? I don't know much about it but that `include "includes/secret.inc";` statement sure looks like it's it's pulling something from another file. Hmm if you go to http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc there's that secret variable that is being referenced in that second if statement. $_POST is an array that in this case contains what you insert in the form, sok, using the secret we discovered, we can get natas7's password easily.
