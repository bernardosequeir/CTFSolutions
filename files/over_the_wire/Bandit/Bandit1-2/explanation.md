```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

The dash (-) is a synonym for stdin, so if you just put it in front of cat it will just present a prompt for you to write. So you need to provide the relative path, because this way, bash can grasp that we are talking about a file.
